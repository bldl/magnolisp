* implement =racket= form

  Any sexps here will be eval'ed as Racket, at top-level, and will be available for use at macro expansion time.

  This means that things like =sc-macro-transformer= can be defined in Racket, within the =racket= form.

  We might actually consider calling it =begin-for-syntax=, as that is what it is called in Racket.

* support an =include= construct (in core language)

  This will allow for loading of the =std-lib.rkt= module, which we will also have to implement.

* implement evalutor and compiler API
