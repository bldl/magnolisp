This is /Magnolisp/, a toy programming language for playing with experimental language implementation techniques and infrastructure. It is implemented in and on top of [[http://racket-lang.org/][Racket]], in a way that allows Racket tools to be used in the development of Magnolisp programs. Code written in Magnolisp can either be evaluated in the Racket VM, or translated into C++.

More details can be found in the [[http://magnolisp.github.io/][manual]].
